        <p>Coding makes my brain tick. It's also quite different to how I first imagined it. This section explores how I've found the area so far. If your brain works like mine, you might well enjoy software development. </p>

There is the school of thought that says "you should start with a *real* programming language like C, because it will teach you all the nasty 'gotchas' that can happen. I don't really agree with it. Java was a great compromise between teaching good practice, and spending all my time working out which bit of memory I'd accidentally overwritten.</dd>
    		<dt>Java, Python or Ruby?</dt>
    		<dd>These are the big three of backend web development (PHP is a bastard and needs to die). Java is the old faithful. Solid, a little bit unwieldy, but gets the job done. The Java family of languages is where it gets interesting. There are a variety of languages that are based on Java, and to a certain point can be used interchangebaly, and Java is the gateway to learning them all. Having said this, these new languages (like Groovy and Scala) are effectively trying to bring Java up to date with Python, so perhaps  </dd>

        <li>There's a range of skills to be learned. Behind any complex website, there is an application, written in something like Java or Python, which does the heavy lifting. There is also the pretty part, the presentation, done in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I didn't which I liked best, so I chose something that covered both. Even though I'm now firmly a backend developer, there are times when HTML and Javascript are really useful.</li>

        <h2>What is Coding like?</h2>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>Pottery with logic</dt>
            <dd>Code is something that you’re constantly shaping. You’re adding components, smoothing parts down and simplifying them. It becomes very intuitive; you'll start to feel the structure of what you're writing before you can put it into words.
            </dd>
            <dt>Many little puzzles</dt>
            <dd>Lots of programming (at least, in the beginning)</dd>
            <dt>Structured</dt>
            <dd>I like structure, and for things to be done the correct way, because I know if something's done badly, it'll come back to bite me later. 
                I'm also a self-confessed Grammar Nazi; the feeling I get when I see badly structured or poorly tested code is similar to the one I get when someone misuses apostrophe's.
            </dd>
            <dt>Simpler than you'd think</dt>
            <dd>Lots of the work is already done for you. Libraries that other people have written are wonderful things. Much of development is breaking your big problem down into a series of smaller ones, which have all been solved by other people.
            </dd>
            <dt>Google is God</dt>
            <dd>Most programmers would probably quake in terror at having to create something from scratch, without a good deal of help from the internet. For almost every problem you have, someone will have encoutered it before, and will probably have posted the solution to a forum somewhere. </dd>

    <p> This is the meat of the site, and the part I expect to be most useful. This is a list of all the tools I used on my journey to becoming a java web developer.

    I should note: The range of programming jobs available is vast. I chose web development for a few reasons:
