                    <h1>Coding is not just for the experts.</h1>
                    <p>A couple of years ago, I decided to become a software developer, with very little programming experience and no relevant qualifications.</p>
                    <p>Much to my surprise, I made it.</p>
                    <p>This site documents what I learned along the way. Hopefully others contemplating a similar path will find it useful.</p>

                    <p>Coding makes my brain tick. It's also quite different to how I first imagined it. This section explores how I've found the area so far. If your brain works like mine, you might well enjoy software development. </p>

                <li>
                    Well written code (in a helpful language) reads like English. It will take very little effort to understand it. If the code’s intention is not clear after reading through it a couple of times, it’s probably badly-written.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A lot of the work is already done for you. Libraries that other people have written are wonderful things. Much of development is breaking your big problem down into a series of smaller ones, which have all been solved by other people.

                <li>
                    There is a lot to learn. Programing is a vast field. After a year, I still feel like I’m just scratching the surface of Java web development. There are hundreds of technologies that I haven’t the first clue about, but could pick up reasonably easily if I wanted.
