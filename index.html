                        <p>
                            Coding is brilliant, and surprisingly, very little experience is required to get a job doing it. Certainly not a Computer Science degree. What's needed is willingness to learn, a logical brain, a chunk of spare time, and persistence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This site is an attempt to kick-start those who are interested in development, but don't know very much about it, or how to start.
                            I began with no real technical background, and just over a year later, landed my first job as Java Web Developer at O2. This is how I got there.     
                        </p>

                        <h2>Why Software Development?</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can build anything you like! It’s the most fantastic feeling, to be able to create whatever you want.</li>
                            <li>You don’t need any formal training to get into it. Hands-on experience counts for a lot. A Computer Science degree counts for very little.
                            </li>
                            <li>It’s really interesting. Day to day, there are a thousand little puzzles to solve. Many of them will drive you crazy, but solving any of them will give you a buzz of achievement.
                            </li>
                            <li>When you’ve got good at it, it’s incredibly well paid.</li>

                        <h2>What is Coding like?</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                My favourite description of programming is “pottery with logic”. Code is something that you’re constantly shaping. You’re adding components, smoothing parts down and simplifying them. It becomes very intuitive; you'll start to feel the structure of what you're writing before you can put it into words.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Well written code (in a helpful language) reads like English. It will take very little effort to understand it. If the code’s intention is not clear after reading through it a couple of times, it’s probably badly-written.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A lot of the work is already done for you. Libraries that other people have written are wonderful things. Much of development is breaking your big problem down into a series of smaller ones, which have all been solved by other people.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There is a lot to learn. Programing is a vast field. After a year, I still feel like I’m just scratching the surface of Java web development. There are hundreds of technologies that I haven’t the first clue about, but could pick up reasonably easily if I wanted.
                            </li>
